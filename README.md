# sicp

A Clojure app to .experiment with concepts from the Structure and 
Interpretation of Computer Programs (SUCP) course that was once taught 
by Abelson and Sussman at MIT (Specifically videos available on YouTube 
form 1986)

## Usage

1. Start the Gorilla task inside Intelli-J
2. Once that starts running, click the link in the Run window (cmd-4)
3. The browser will load Online Viewer with the default page
4. see http://gorilla-repl.org/start.html for more details (note: ctrl-g ctrl-g brings up built-in help)

4. Back in Intelli-J, run the Gorilla-REPL task

5. this starts a repl connected to the browser viewer
6. any changes in the RELP will be reflected in the browser
7. be sure to execute the (ns ...) at the top on any file
8. and then execute the (require ...) of that same namespace to get it loaded and active in the REPL

9. back in the browser, you can edit the code blocks and see their results by using shift-enter
10. execute all the blocks on the page with ctrl-shift-enter (note: Gorilla used "ctrl" not "cmd")
10. clicking in any block lets you edit right in the browser

11. to save changes made in the browser, be sure to use ctrl-g, ctrl-s
